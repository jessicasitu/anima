## Welcome Screen

Welcome to the ANIMA Research Study

Thank you for participating in this study exploring how AI reflective 
companions can support women's hormonal self-understanding.

ANIMA is an AI-powered tool that offers personalized reflections based 
on your hormonal patterns and emotional state. Unlike typical cycle 
tracking apps or wearables that just show you data, ANIMA uses real-time 
AI to generate thoughtful, personalized reflections that 
adapt to your current state.

We're investigating whether this kind of AI companion can help users 
develop greater self-understanding and emotional acceptance—and how 
it compares to other tools you may have used.

Before you interact with ANIMA, we'd like to learn about:
- Your current relationship with your body and cycle
- Your experience with other health/wellness tools and AI
- Your thoughts on AI for personal wellbeing

There are no right or wrong answers—we're interested in your honest experience.

This survey takes approximately 6-8 minutes.
Your responses are confidential and will only be used for research purposes.

Thank you for completing this pre-survey!

You're now ready to begin your session with ANIMA.

ANIMA uses real AI to generate personalized 
reflections based on simulated estradiol patterns and your self-reported 
state. The AI follows the Reflective Agency Framework—it won't diagnose 
you or tell you what to do, but will offer gentle possibilities and 
open questions.

Please let the researchers know you've finished.
