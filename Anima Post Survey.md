## Welcome Screen

```
Thank you for completing your ANIMA session!

We'd now like to hear about your experience with this AI reflective 
companion. Your feedback will help us understand:

- Whether AI can genuinely help with hormonal self-understanding
- How ANIMA compares to other tools you've used
- What makes an AI companion feel helpful (or not)
- How to improve AI tools for women's health

Your honest feedback—positive or negative—is valuable.

This survey takes approximately 10-12 minutes.
